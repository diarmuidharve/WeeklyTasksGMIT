# WeeklyTasksGMIT
Programming and scripting: Weekly Tasks	
Higher diploma in data analytics GMIT
Overview:
The objective of this repository is to showcase the continuous work carried out by me during-the-course of my semester long studies at GMIT. The software I used was Anaconda and the Spyder language to be used in conjunction the Python programming language.

In order to properly see the work I have completed it is necessary to download the above packages 

Topics: 
Topic 1: Basics of programming, where we were introduced to the programming environment and downloaded the necessary packages, such as the ones above. There were no weekly tasks this week.
Topic 2: A more in-depth intro into programming where we used packages such as VS-Code, we were also instructed to complete to complete a BMI calculator to compute a figure of 20.06, from a height of 180CM and a weight of 65KG. To complete this task I manipulated the code from a YouTube video, shown both in references below and in the script itself. The main obstacle I encountered here was that the YouTube creator had manipulated the code to be used for metres rather then CM, therefore I had to manipulate it with an equation shown below.

This gives us the desired output whether they input their height in CM or metres, the output can be seen below.

Topic three: 
For our third instalment of weekly tasks we were requested to write a programme that takes an input of a sentence and outputs every second letter in reverse order. The sentence in question was ‘’ The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.’’, which should create a desired output of ‘’ .o zletrv pu o wr cu h’’. To figure out how to do this I used the site GeeksForGeeks, as I was able to use a combination of the five different methods that they used.
 
The main issue I encountered here is the online tutorial showed us to -1, although for this programme to run it needed to be -2. 
Topic four: For this weekly task we were instructed to define a Collatz function in order to divide a number by two, if it does not divide equally by two it multiplies by three and adds one, till it eventually reaches 1. This was in order to showcase our knowledge of while loops, else and elif cases and if statements. The output is shown below.

Topic five: 
In this topic we researched Toggle. This was in my opinion the more difficult topic and I spent a long time getting the print functions to work properly.

Shown as being run on a weekday.

Topic six: 
In this week’s tasks we were instructed to find a method of getting the square root through the Newtown method in python. I found this quite difficult as I wrongly entered a float, rather then an integer therefore it would not accept 14.5, only 14.

Topic seven: 
During this week we focused on importing files, and counting instances of the number of E’s

Topic eight: 
 For this week’s task we were instructed to plot a graph
